# What does exactly it do?
- It verifies your installed packages either on your global environment, virtual environment, whatever it will take each library, package or/and framework. 
- Compare packages between requirements.txt file converted to list and installed_packages_list. 
- Finally, packages aren't installed yet, it will do recursively.
